## What's that Lingo

one day ill finish this project

not soon tho

## Update February 10/25

- Got it working using Qdrant instead of weaviate
- Currently using `nomic-embed-text-v1`
- Semantic Search results aren't as valuable as hoped

Things to try:
- enrich embedding vectors with more context
- upgrade to use either `nomic-embed-text-v1.5` or `bge-large-en-v1.5` to understand 'slang' better
- hybrid/keyword search
